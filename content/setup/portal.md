### Login to AWS Workshop Portal

This workshop creates an ephemeral AWS acccount for you to use only for this workshop.  

**This account will be torn down and not accessible 1 hour after the workshop.**

You will need the **Participant Hash** provided upon entry, and your email address to track your unique session.

Connect to the portal by clicking the button or browsing to the following url:

[**https://dashboard.eventengine.run/**](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/).

We will provide you with a hash code.  Enter this code when you see the following screen.
